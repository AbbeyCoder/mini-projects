Four main pillar of object oriented programming

1) Encapsulation
2) Abstraction 
3) Inheritance
4) polymorphism



1) Encapsulation ==============

Using Encapsulation we group related variables and functions together
and it can reduce complexity
and also increase reusability

2) Abstraction ==============

hide the detail and complexity and show only the essential this techniques
reduce complexity and also isolate the impact of changes

3) Inheritance ==============

Eliminate redundant (redundant meaning Bekar) code

4) polymorphism ==============

Refactor Ugly switch/case statements


we will learn 

. Creating object 
. Factories and constructor
. Primitive and referance type
. Working with properties
. Private properties
. Getters / setters


In OOP word property mean to hold value and the word method mean some logic
